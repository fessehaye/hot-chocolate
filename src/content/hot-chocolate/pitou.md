An apple pie-inspired, white hot chocolate with traditional pie flavours of cinnamon, vanilla and Granny Smith apples. Topped with whipped cream and cinnamon-sugar.

Served on the side, stroopwafel - a thin, round waffle cookie made from two layers of sweet baked dough held together with caramel filling.
