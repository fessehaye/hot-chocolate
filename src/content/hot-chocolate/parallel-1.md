review: This just tasted/smelled like a regular hot chocolate to me. I liked the donut but I do not think it matched with the drink

Dark hot chocolate infused with cardamom and organic rose petals.

Served with a mini brioche doughnut filled with spiced chocolate custard and topped with orange blossom glaze, pistachios and rose petals.
