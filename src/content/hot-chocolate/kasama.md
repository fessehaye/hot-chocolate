review: It was equally as good as the other Ube hot chocolate. Hard time deciding which one was better.

"
A homage to the Philippine dessert with the same name, this purple-coloured drinking chocolate features ube (Phillippine purple yam) and pandan and is topped with a floating calamansi meringue. The ube pandan white chocolate used in this drink is made in house and will evoke flavours of almonds, vanilla and coconut.

Served with an ube pandan shortbread cookie.
