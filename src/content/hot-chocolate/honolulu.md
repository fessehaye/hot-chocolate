review: I liked the cotton candy but the drink was a little over-hyped haha. It was a easy to drink, I just felt a little underwhelmed. I feel like the donut one they had would be a better choice!

You'll know you're in Vancouver when you see this fun, 70% dark hot chocolate (with pink Himalayan salt ) melting a cloud-shaped mass of cotton candy suspended over the cup. It's raining!
