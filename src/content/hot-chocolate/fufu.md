review: One of the first drinks I had, and I still think about it. Probably my favorite one. Fufu's was my favorite last year too!

An ode to creativity with organic white miso paste, cream cheese and Valrhona 35% Blond Dulcey chocolate, this hot chocolate is topped with house made miso cheese whipped cream and nori (seaweed flakes). It's a sweet and savoury hot drink that brings an audacious experience to the table.

Paired with a classic cheesecake bar covered with Japanese rice cracker bits.
