review: Top 3 or 5 drink for me! They make hot chocolates year round, so I would like to go back

A 35% strawberry chili white hot chocolate with roasted coconut flakes.
Paired with Dark Moon (rum truffle with fresh vanilla bean).

"This is a story of a little strawberry whose life is whirling and rippling in this drink like a flame of a dreamy flamenco dancer in her long, flowing dress; this is a drink where the roots of a little chile pepper whispers her secrets to the heart of the dancing strawberry....Come, get a sip, let their passion heal you..." -- Paul Dincer
