review: I wanted to try their PISTACHIO drink so badly, but this drink makes me forget about it. Might be the only drink I will put effort into trying it a second time!

House made dark chocolate sauce perfectly infused with a rich cream and crowned by a dollop of decadent mascarpone whip.

Paired with a fresh baked, chocolate-dipped, chocolate biscotti from Italia Bakery

\*We travelled to Torino, Italy - a chocolate lover's heaven - and sampled this authentic Italian drinking chocolate. The mascarpone whip complements the drink beautifully, but also teeters this indulgence into dessert territory.
