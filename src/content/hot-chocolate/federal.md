Malted 66% Valrhona Caraïbe hot chocolate with whip cream, topped with crispy, candied, rye bread crumble and malted rim. Reminds us of being 10-years-old and walking to our local corner store for a frozen malted milk. (But this one is a lot cozier!)

Served with house made dark chocolate and candied rye "malteser".
