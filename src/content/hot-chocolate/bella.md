White Chocolate and Ube is made by mixing our Filipino ube paste with Michel Cluziel Elianza 33% Ivory chocolate to create this unique hot chocolate. We slow cook the ube until it becomes smooth with no clumps and then we melt it inside the hot chocolate The drink will come with whipped cream on top if requested.

On the side: cannoli filled with coconut gelato.
